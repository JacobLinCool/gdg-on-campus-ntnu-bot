# GDG on Campus: NTNU Bot

A Discord bot that helps GDG on Campus: NTNU (National Taiwan Normal University) instructors manage students in a classroom environment, track lab completion, and organize students into groups.

## Features

### Classroom & Lab Management

- **Classroom & Group Setup**: Create classrooms and assign students to discussion or lab groups.
- **Live Enrollment Tracking**: Monitor student enrollment and group assignments in real time.
- **Lab Session Control**: Start lab sessions, let students mark completion, and track their progress live.

- **Bevy API Integration**: Pulls real-time data from GDG community events.
